# Float to Euro (€) Converter

## Description

I made this project just because I thought some might need it. It is just a small little helper but in the Project I am currently working on, i needed this anyway, so why not make a module out of this idea.

The idea is simple, you insert a number and it gives you a string with the proper representation in the Euro currency.

(And sorry for my bad english, I am not a native speaker)

## Installation & Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/theWasweisich/number_to_euro_convert.git
```

In Python Code:
```
import number_to_euro as nte

print(nte(12.5))
# 12,50€
```
